# HowLongToBeat Go Scraper

This is a simple scraper for the [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com) website.

This surely can be improved in many ways, I really don't know anything about Go or web scraping, I just needed this tools
for another project and did this with the help of my friend Claude AI.

## Usage

```bash
go run main.go
```

## TODO

- idk maybe deeply understanding the code after properly learning Go.

### Scraper

- More detailed scraping
- Return game url and id

### API
